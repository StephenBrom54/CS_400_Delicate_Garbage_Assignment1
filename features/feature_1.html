                        As a teacher, I want to be able to create multiple inventories for different classrooms so that I can keep track of classroom items.<br><br>
            
                        As a teacher, I want to ensure that each classroom has enough resources to meet the needs of students and teachers. <br><br>
            
                        <h3>Constraints</h3> 
                        This will also require a ticketing mechanism whereby someone can mark restocks as complete. <br><br>
                        
                        This will require teachers to proactively keep inventory updated and for administrators to take care of the reported needs. <br><br>
