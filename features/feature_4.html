                        As an educator, I need to easily view the inventory and conditions of each classroom in advance of my classes. <br><br>

                        As a teacher, I want to be able to check the state of my classroom when class is not in session so I can see what needs to be done before classes resume.  <br><br>
                                                 
                        As a member of a teaching staff, I want to view real-time information on classroom conditions.  <br><br>                        
                        
                        Working in Educational Services, as a Director, I want teachers to track the overall well-being of their classrooms, aiding in strategic planning for the future.   <br><br>
            
                        <h3>Constraints</h3> 
                        This will require determining a meaningful mechanism for conveying information in a visiual way. <br><br>
