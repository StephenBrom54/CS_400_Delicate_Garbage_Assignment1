                        As a teacher, I want to be able to assess the quality of my classroom assets, such as textbooks, calculators, and whiteboards, so that I can identify areas for improvement and make changes to optimize classroom learning and student success. <br><br>

                        Working in Educational Services, as a Director, I want teachers to check the state of their classrooms over breaks, addressing any issues before classes resume. <br><br>

                        As a teacher, I want to be able to monitor the state of the classroom so that I can ensure that the classroom environment is conducive to learning and that students are comfortable. <br><br> 

                        As a teacher, I want to be able to view the state of the classroom in real-time so that I can address issues as they arise. <br><br>
            
                        <h3>Constraints</h3> 
                        This will require teachers to keep quality information updated. <br><br>
