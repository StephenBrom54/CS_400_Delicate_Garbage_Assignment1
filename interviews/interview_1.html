        <h2>Interview 1</h2>
        <p>Interview date: January 12, 2024 <br><br>

            Interviewer: Adam Elias

            <h3>Needs/ideas: </h3>
            
            <ul>
            <li>A solution for streamlining teaching in shared rooms.</li> <br>
            
            <li>Things would need to manage: actual space, seating # and furniture arrangement, technology and other equipment, like clickers</li> <br>
            
            <li>Would love to make suggestions on room looks, condition, etc., without having to go through an unfamiliar facilities request process that only admin assistants might understand</li> <br>
            
            <li>Knowing room setup and the stuff inside would help with better classroom scheduling, rather than the current process that only looks at room capacity</li> <br>
            </ul>             
            
            <h3>Concerns:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Wouldn't want it to seem like a black hole or a suggestion box that nobody looks at or addresses, this could easily happen. <br>
            
            <li>If it's complicated or even slightly not easy, people won't use it. <br>
            
            <li>Be careful that it's not a shadow process of existing facility procedures, so somebody might have to do extra work to feed it into that process.  <br></p>
            </ul>
