        <h2>Interview 4</h2>
        <p>Interview date: January 12, 2024 <br><br>

            Interviewer: Danny Cannon
            <br><br>
            <h3>Needs/ideas: </h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Alerts: Keep admins and teachers updated through multiple methods when inventory is low. <br><br>

                <li>Admins can track trends in classroom & inventory usage over time by collecting the data. <br><br>
                
                <li>Mobile app: could work on smartphone or tablet <br><br>
                
                <li>Integrate with other programs: schools are already using learning management systems and software to track student data, so the software could somehow plug into those systems. <br><br>
                
                <li>Customization: Schools should be able to change the interface so that all their teachers can see what the schoolsâ€™ classrooms look like and what their needs are. <br><br>
            </ul>             
            
            <h3>Concerns:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Training: all teachers of any age need to be able to use the software, which requires time <br><br>

                <li>Technical difficulties: what happens when something goes wrong? <br><br>
                
                <li>Privacy <br><br></p>
