1.  What is the product?
The product is a software application that tracks the state and inventory of a certain classification of spaces (classrooms) in a certain classification of organization (school/college/university).  It allows users to easily input feedback and contribute to the inventory and state-tracking functionality, so administrators can ensure the facilities are kept in a standardized and high-quality state, with sufficient supplies.
 
2.  What are possible names of the product
Early ideas (admittedly all pretty bad...just brainstorming):
Classy, Class Condition, Class State, Class Stash, State of Class, Classroom Upkeeper, Class Upkeep, Upkeep-a-Class, UpTeach, ... 
 
3.  Who are the potential customers, end users or buyers
Potential customers: Education organizations
End users/buyers:  Instructors, administrators and facilities directors of education organizations
 
4.  What are the potential features, functions, or other important details that would be appealing to customers, end users or buyers.
Potential features and functions:
-An updated list of classrooms from a functional perspective, rather than for scheduling (in my experience, tracking classrooms is often limited to available space and capacities, without much regard for the state, condition, and inventory of those spaces.
-Inventory list for each classroom
-Condition of each classroom, on some kind of meaningful scale or spectrum, maybe color-coded?
-The ability for room users to provide feedback or notifications about classroom condition, needs, inventory, etc.  This would be functionally different/easier/better than simply submitting a ticket to a helpdesk such as IT, which may not be responsible for classroom aesthetics or inventory.
-Maybe this involves QR codes.  At the very least, a user could scan a QR code that could take them to an input form, which could be tied to a list.  I don't know how simple or complicated that would end up being, though.  Let's not try to use every programming concept we've covered in the program so far.
-To simplify, the inventory control feature might also treat classroom condition as an inventory item, though maybe with a specific range of string inputs that would correspond to a pretty-looking visual scale of the classroom's overall condition.  E.g., if "whiteboard condition" is a 2 out of 5, the scale shows as red for that item.
-Maybe all of the info is surfaced in a pretty dashboard of some kind, which can be viewed per room.

**Product Vision Statement: For school administrators and instructors who need an ideal way to monitor their classroom setting, Classy is a software that provides a comprehensive platform to monitor classroom state and inventory while allowing users to submit feedback about classroom needs through a user-friendly interface. Unlike products such as Sortly and Skyward, Classy goes beyond simple inventory management by reflecting the quality of assets and the classrooms themselves, leading to optimal classroom learning and student success.**
