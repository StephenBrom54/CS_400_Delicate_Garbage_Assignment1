        <h2>Persona 1: "Arwen"</h2>
        <p>“Arwen,” a 32-year-old assistant professor in the Nursing Department at a small regional university, has lived in the same city her entire life, and she takes immense pride in her university and is eager to see it thrive. Arwen is early in her career, only recently completed her PhD, and wants to make an impact.  However, her enthusiasm is often dampened by the outdated and disorganized state of the building where she teaches. Faced with inefficient classroom management and a slow process for addressing facility issues, she yearns for a more streamlined and effective system. <br><br>

        Recognizing the potential for improvement, Arwen sees Classy as a potential step in the right direction. She believes this software could raise the bar on how classrooms are managed, making the process more efficient and empowering faculty to take pride in their teaching environment, perhaps for the first time in many of their careers. For Arwen, Classy represents more than just an organizational tool; it's a potential means to reinvigorate the department and enhance the overall educational experience. As a forward-thinking educator, she is excited about the prospects of fostering a better, more responsive, and engaging learning atmosphere for both teachers and students. </p>
