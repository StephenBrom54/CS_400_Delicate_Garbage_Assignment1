        <h2>Persona 2: "Haley"</h2>
        <p>"Haley," age 25, is a kindergarten teacher in a public school in Louisville. She recently graduated from the University of Kentucky with a master's degree in early childhood education. She teaches children from ages 4-6 and will help with the preschool class on occasion. She was born and raised in Louisville. Her father raised her as a single parent. He is a partner at a prestigious law firm. She never knew her mother. She has no children, but she wants to have some in the future. She considers her students to be like her children in the meantime and wants them to get the best out of life.  <br><br>

        Haley is very interested in ways to make classroom upkeep easier. Her students are not the best at keeping track of classroom equipment or picking up after themselves. She is very interested in digitally keeping track of the supplies and state of her classroom.  </p>
