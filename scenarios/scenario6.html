        <div class="scenario">
        <p>
            At the end of the school day, Haley's classroom is in rough shape. Paint has spilled on desks and the carpet, the classroom sink is out of soap, and the chalkboard is in poor shape. She inputs all this information on Classy, and each incident is marked in red as a high priority. <br><br>

            After she leaves, the custodians come in, and the next day her classroom is spotless. She receives a notification on her Classy phone app letting her know that her room has been taken care of and who she needs to thank for cleaning and restocking it. She logs her requests as complete.
