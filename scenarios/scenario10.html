        <p>
            Karrie is preparing for the new academic year and wants to ensure that her classroom has all the necessary equipment and supplies. She uses Classy to create an inventory of classroom items, such as textbooks, calculators, and whiteboard markers. She can easily add new items to the inventory and update the quantity of existing items. She also sets up automated alerts to notify her when inventory levels are low. This helps her ensure that she has enough resources to meet the needs of her students throughout the year.
