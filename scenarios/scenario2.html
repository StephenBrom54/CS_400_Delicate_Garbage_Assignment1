        <h2>Scenario 2: "Arwen"</h2>

        <div class="scenario">
        <p>
            Arwen is always looking for ways to enhance the learning environment for her nursing students. She realizes that both students and teachers have valuable insights into how classrooms could be improved, but there hasn't been an efficient way to gather and act on this feedback. This changes with Classy's ability for users to scan a QR code in each room to offer suggestions. These codes, when scanned, lead to a simple interface where students and faculty can submit suggestions about the room's conditions, equipment needs, and aesthetics. <br><br>
            
            Arwen announces this new initiative during her lecture, encouraging students to scan the QR code and share their thoughts on how to make the classroom more conducive to learning. She emphasizes that their feedback is valuable and will be directly used to improve their educational experience. <br><br>

            The response is enthusiastic. Students and faculty alike start scanning the QR codes, submitting a variety of suggestions. Some students propose better lighting to create a more vibrant atmosphere, while others request additional resources like anatomical models for a more hands-on learning experience. Faculty members suggest ergonomic furniture for longer lectures and improved audio-visual equipment. <br><br>            

            Back in her office, Arwen checks the Classy dashboard, which has aggregated all the feedback in a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate format. She's impressed by the detailed and constructive suggestions and sees patterns emerging on what improvements are most needed. <br><br>
            
            Arwen shares this dashboard with the university's facilities management team and works with them to prioritize and address the feedback. Over the next few months, several improvements are made: brighter, energy-efficient lighting is installed, new medical models are added to the labs, and ergonomic chairs replace the old lecture hall seating. <br><br>                         

            The impact of these changes is immediately noticeable. Students express their appreciation for being involved in the decision-making process, and faculty members feel more supported in their teaching efforts. This direct feedback loop, facilitated by Classy, not only enhances the physical environment of the classrooms but also fosters a stronger sense of community and collaboration within the nursing department. </p>
