        <p>
            Karrie is teaching a math class and notices that some of her students are struggling with the material. She uses Classy to assess the quality of the classroom assets, such as textbooks, calculators, and whiteboards. She discovers that some of the textbooks are outdated and that some of the calculators are not functioning properly. She uses this information to make a case for upgrading the classroom assets. <br><br>

            Karrie presents her findings to the school administration and convinces them to invest in new textbooks and calculators. She is grateful for the quality assessment feature of Classy, which helped her identify areas for improvement and make changes to optimize classroom learning and student success. <br><br>

            By using Classy to assess the quality of her classroom assets, Karrie can ensure that the classroom environment is conducive to learning and that students have access to high-quality resources. She is grateful for the ease of use and the quality assessment feature, which helps her identify areas for improvement and make changes to optimize classroom learning and student success.
