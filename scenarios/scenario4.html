        <div class="scenario">
        <p>
            Haley has been tasked with getting an inventory list prepared for her classroom for the spring semester. She starts by logging into her remote account for Classy at home to check what the condition her room was in before Christmas break.  <br><br>

            She logs what supplies she was low on so that they can be restocked before the students return. <br><br>

            Once she logs her request for supplies, she checks on the previous state of the classroom and inputs the state of the classroom and notes anything that might need to be replaced or cleaned. Her notes are forwarded to the custodial staff, where they will be added to their list of tasks to be completed over the break.  </p>
