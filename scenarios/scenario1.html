        <h2>Scenario 1: "Arwen"</h2>

        <div class="scenario">
        <p>
            Arwen has noticed that the nursing classrooms in her university are often improperly equipped for the variety of classes that take place in her building of the university, leading to delays and disruptions. Determined to address this, she decides to utilize Classy to streamline the management of classroom resources. <br><br>
            
            First, Arwen conducts a survey with her colleagues in the Nursing department to identify the specific needs and challenges in each classroom. She finds that the requirements vary significantly depending on the course, ranging from the need for advanced medical mannequins in practical nursing classes to specific audio-visual equipment for theoretical lectures. This variation in needs supports the importance of a customizable management system. <br> <br>

            With this information, Arwen logs into Classy and begins setting up individual profiles for each classroom in the nursing department. She categorizes the rooms based on their primary use - practical labs, lecture halls, and seminar rooms. For each category, she inputs the standard required equipment, then further customizes each room's profile based on additional feedback from faculty members. <br><br>

            Using Classy's intuitive interface, Arwen adds inventories of current equipment and flags items needing repair or replacement. She also sets up a feature where faculty can quickly report any issues or additional needs directly through the system. This direct line of communication is designed to expedite maintenance and resource allocation, bypassing the slow administrative processes. <br><br>

            After configuring the system, Arwen introduces Classy to the nursing faculty in a department meeting. She demonstrates how they can use the application to check the status of their classroom before their classes, report any issues, and request additional resources. The faculty are encouraged to update and refine the system continuously based on their experiences and needs. <br><br>

            Once Classy is fully operational, the nursing department notices an immediate improvement. Classrooms are better equipped, issues are resolved faster, and there is a noticeable uptick in both faculty and student satisfaction. Arwen's initiative, backed by Classy, leads to a more efficient and effective learning environment, reflecting her commitment to enhancing the educational experience at her university. <br><br>
