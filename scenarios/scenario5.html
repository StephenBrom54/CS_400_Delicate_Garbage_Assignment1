        <h2>Scenario 5: "Haley"</h2>

        <div class="scenario">
        <p>
            Haley returned to school after the break. Her requests had been completed before the break ended, and employees who were involved in their completion were logged as well. <br><br>

            During her first day back, there were two students absent. She looks on Classy to see if parents have called the school and if those absences are excused.  <br><br>

            If the absences are excused, there is a notification on Classy. If it is not excused, Classy will alert Haley at 8:15 a.m., which is five minutes after class is expected to start. The alert includes the names of the students and parents and any contact information. <br><br>

            If Haley decides to do so, she can send an automated text message to the parents through Classy.   </p>
