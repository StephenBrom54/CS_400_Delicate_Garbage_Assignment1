        <h2>Scenario 3: "Arwen"</h2>

        <div class="scenario">
        <p>
            Arwen is tasked with organizing the upcoming semester's class schedule for the nursing department. She aims to assign each class to the most suitable room, considering various factors like room capacity, seating arrangement, available inventory, furniture, and specific teaching materials like whiteboards and projectors.  Aware of the complexity of this task, she turns to Classy for assistance. <br><br>

            Using Classy's scheduling feature, Arwen inputs the requirements for each course: the number of students, preferred seating layout, necessary medical equipment for practical lessons, and audio-visual needs for seminars and theory-based classes. Classy analyzes this data against the attributes and availability of each room in the department. The software's intelligent algorithm suggests optimal room assignments, ensuring that each class is placed in a space that best fits its specific needs. <br><br>

            Arwen reviews and fine-tunes these suggestions, impressed by the system's efficiency in aligning course requirements with the ideal teaching environment. She finalizes the schedule, confident that Classy has helped her allocate resources effectively, ensuring that each class has the appropriate space, equipment, and materials for an optimal learning experience. As the semester begins, both faculty and students appreciate the thoughtful room assignments. Practical nursing classes are held in well-equipped labs, while lecture courses enjoy comfortable and tech-ready spaces. This strategic room allocation, facilitated by Classy, not only streamlines the scheduling process but also enhances the overall educational quality of the nursing department.  </p>
