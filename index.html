        <h2>About Classy</h2>
        <p>Classy is the ultimate classroom management solution, providing education professionals and administrators with a simple, intuitive, and effective solution for ensuring classroom facilities are well-kept, stocked, and ready for learners.  </p>
        <p>Classy is designed for those who upkeep and maintain classrooms, as well as for those who use them.  The application allows classroom users to provide instant feedback on classroom conditions and inventory.  Are the dry erase markers running out?  Is a desk in need of maintenance?  Could the walls use a fresh coat of paint?  This feedback is routed to a database of all classroom facilities, which is displayed in an easy-to-read dashboard, allowing administrators and facilities personnel to monitor the needs of each individual classroom, and respond accordingly, without having to wait for a ticket to be routed through a helpdesk, or for a phone or email message to be relayed through a complicated or ambiguous chain of contacts.  </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>For school administrators and instructors who need an ideal way to monitor their classroom setting, Classy is a software that provides a comprehensive platform to monitor classroom state and inventory while allowing users to submit feedback about classroom needs through a user-friendly interface. Unlike products such as Sortly and Skyward, Classy goes beyond simple inventory management by reflecting the quality of assets and the classrooms themselves, leading to optimal classroom learning and student success.</p>
